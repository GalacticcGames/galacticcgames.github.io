You can also find links to our repositories of our projects and free products, as well as links to the various marketplaces we sell on, our featured product or most recent developments, and more!

                            <h3 class="content-block-section-header">About Us:</h3>
                            Galacticc Games is an indie game and game-related software development studio that works to create products and solutions for game development. Our focus is to create quality products that are relevant and usable for the everyday creator and able to assist them in making their project development more efficient and worthwhile. The products we make originate from our own development experience and are used in our own projects. Oftentimes in our creation process, we run into an issue and find out that there is no solution readily available, so we create these solutions not just to help us, but to also help out the game development community too. We list products primarily for <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a> and <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/">Unreal Engine</a>. Our products can be found on the <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/109419">Unity Marketplace</a> and <a href="https://www.fab.com/sellers/Galacticc%20Games">Fab</a>, as well as free solutions on GitHub.
                            <br><br>
                            In addition to the game development products we make, we also develop video games themselves. As of now, our projects are in early development so it will be awhile before any specific information comes out about them. But, once they are far enough along, we will be making posts and devlogs chronicling our development, so be sure to follow us for updates!

                                    A visual effect plugin for Unreal Engine. Get it <a href="https://www.fab.com/listings/5e9a2662-1125-4057-9295-d02606b57355">here</a> today!

                                    Streamline is a collection of several <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/creating-visual-effects-in-niagara-for-unreal-engine">Niagara</a> Modules, Functions, Inputs, Templates, and a <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/blueprints-visual-scripting-in-unreal-engine">Blueprint</a> used to run enhanced <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/blueprint-spline-component-property-reference-in-unreal-engine">spline</a>-based simulation through Niagara. These modules are compatible with any rendering module and can influence position, rotation, scale, velocity, color, and more! Whether you are new to Niagara or experienced with emitters you can use these assets to streamline your Niagara workflow today!
                                    <br><br>
                                    Normally, to use splines with Niagara, you have to set up your own sampling and spline system, and this can be a time consuming process. There is little documentation on how to work with spline integration and this can make the process long and painful. This asset pack changes that. With Streamline you can easily create Niagara systems influenced by or directly from splines in seconds. You can use and modify pre-built templates or create your own systems using the different spline sampling options for maximum customization.

                            Feel free to check out our <a href="https://github.com/GalacticcGames?tab=repositories">GitHub repositories</a> and see what we are working on and have developed. Any of the code in our GitHub repositories is free for you to use and modify for any of your own projects. Most of what we will have on our GitHub will be tools and scripts that will be useful for development in game engines such as <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/">Unreal</a> and <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a>. This may be anything from simple math libraries to editor extensions to speed up various workflows. All of the tools that we put here for your use are also used by us in our everyday development. These are real solutions to fix issues and maximize efficiency that are tried and tested by us, and we hope that they improve your development too.
